**PAUSED INDEFINITELY -- instead see joy-data-kotlin**

Joy Data is inspired by Clojure's philosophy of "modeling data as data". It aspires to gently float a runtime-type-checked data manipulation environment above Swift's static type system. Joy values are immutable and are manipulated in a functional style.
